## Tools Used
I typically use Microsoft Word to type my documents. I find it simple to use and the format gives me a peace of mind because I can see the layout of the document. To back up m files, I use OneDrive and it downloads to my phone, my tablet, and my computer. If I am on an outside resoruce computer, not my own, I will save the document and email it to myself. Once back at my own device, I will download the document and then save it to my OneDrive. I do have a flash drive that I use in random scenarios, but I do not use it frequently in fear of losing it, resulting in losing all of my work.
## Practicing the Symbols

# Practice
## Using git hub for the first time
While practicing *github* I can use **symbols** instead of clicking on formatting tools. 
I feel like once I am more familiar with the way raw text works and the way github works, I will use it more often. But I will say, I am struggling to grasp the idea of not seeing the layout of the document. 
 _ to make a bulleted list I will use an underscore
 _ bullet list
 _ bullet list
 _ bullet list
 The bullet format is not working, what am I doing wrong.
