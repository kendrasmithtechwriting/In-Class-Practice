Sodium levels are high in Americans and are becoming a prevalent problem. Learning ways to reduce sodium levels and knowing what it is and how to avoid it, it could help extend the life span of Americans. 

There are several sites that I have gathered and put into my white page repository under Research Abstract if you want to take a look at that. None of them are lengthy, but they all have a piece of useful information. To find those sources, I searched for sodium in food, american sodium intake, sodium levels, benefits of sodium, and nutrition information on sodium.
